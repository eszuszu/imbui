# Imbui Pulse
**WIP**
Details on the pulse package, a lightweight solution for atomic reactivity using signals and effects:

  - Why signals and effects rather than traditional pub/sub, eventing, or even observables?—The answer is that all approaches have their place depending on context and scope, as well as desired effects.
  - Will elaborate: Signals vs Observables vs 'State' (react), Effects vs Events, More info about design patterns in `imbui/core`

### Signals
Details on how to use signals atomically within web components or even Node.js applications.
Signals vs. 'observables'?

### Effects
An elaboration on the mechanics of effects and how to use them—
Dependency tracking, automatic reactivity, `effect()`, vs. `computed()`, cleanup.
