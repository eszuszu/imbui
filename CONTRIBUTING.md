### Code Standards

### Conventional Commits

Please follow the conventional commit standard as written about here: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

<blockquote>
<br>
&ldquo;The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
</li>
<li>
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
</li>
<li>
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
</li>
<li>
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
</li>
<li>
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.&rdquo;
<br>

This helps keep things maintainable as the project scales and should make versioning easy-peasy going forward.
