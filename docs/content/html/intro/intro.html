<h2>imbui is a forward looking, front-end toolkit for authoring browser native Custom Element web components and interactive experiences.</h2>
<p>Built to utilize the browser and client-side capabilities, outside of the black-box of monolithic frameworks and ecosystems—<em>imbui</em> takes a <em>framework atomics</em> approach instead. It offers modular, composable packages, that can be used together synergistically or can individually slot into your project; Modern approaches to reactivity with <code>signals</code> and <code>effects</code>, <em>component mixins</em>, <em>decorators</em>, and utilities, and a small <em>templating engine</em> built on tagged template literals provide an endless range of possibilites to compose and design.</p>
<p><strong>the vision, imbui</strong></p>
<p>Learn the fundamentals of native <em>custom elements</em>, the <em>shadow DOM</em> and alternative approaches to style isolation, and more. Open up a whole new paradigm of building on the client. </p>
<p>SPA, SSR, SSG, RPC, alphabet soup! Don&#39;t know what any of this is? That&#39;s okay, sometimes you just want a static website with a game—or widget; you&#39;re prototyping, learning, perfect. I built <code>imbui</code> with <em>learners</em>, <em>design engineers</em>, <em>prototypers</em> and <em>framework authors</em> in mind, that means its meant to be as unopinionated as I can make it. No React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte, not even Solid, or Lit. <em>imbui</em> was built with no outside dependendencies, just dev dependencies. That means you can use it as a base, pick pieces of it apart, or extend it at will without needing to buy into any other ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p><strong><code>imbui/pulse</code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code>imbui/cast</code></strong></p>
<p><strong><code>imbui/infuse</code></strong> (dependency: pulse)</p>
<p><strong><code>imbui/core</code></strong> (dependency: pulse &amp; infuse)</p>
<p>Each package can be imported individually.</p>
<p><code>core</code> is the most opinionated and includes both pulse and infuse. It&#39;s a microframework for custom elements  built with imbui&#39;s other packages, but with no opinion about rendering to the DOM beyond custom elemnts. It offers the scaffolding for more involved projects: a context provider API, dependency injection workflows, services for client-side routing. Fetching utilities, and animation helpers, and exposes <code>infuse</code> and <code>pulse</code> and their primitives for your own building.</p>
<p><code>infuse</code> is all about composing custom elements. It introduces the utility <code>infuse</code> that makes applying chains of custom element mixins seamless and type aware. It contain&#39;s a Base custom element mixin together with a suite of mixins for extensible reactivity and DOM book-keeping. It also includes declarative web component standard TypeScript <strong>decorators</strong>, for hooking into custom elements to extend their behavior—like adding reactive attributes, or logging lifecycle methods.</p>
<p><code>pulse</code> powers all of the reactivity in core and is my implementation of <code>signal</code> and <code>effect</code> primitives and the general design pattern. Super light-weight, pulse can be used alone to drive reactivity in your project, used as the primary reactive driver for <code>imbui</code> components or workflows, or to extend custom solutions. Signals hold state, effects react automatically when signals change.</p>
<p><code>cast</code> is an HTML templating solution built with tagged template literals and the <code>TemplateStringsArray</code> they utilize. Inspired by <code>lit.js</code>, <code>marked.js</code>, and the philosophy of optimized, atomic updates—you can create static html layouts that contain &#39;slots&#39; for dynamic content. Render nested templates, lists, even create <em>keyed</em> lists with the <code>keyed</code> directive for truly atomic updates to dynamically rendered list.</p>
