# Imbui
A lightweight Front-End toolkit for authoring HTML custom element web components with TypeScript. It provides a modular approach to building, with:

  - `imbui/core`: An opinionated core for a fast tracked workflow.

  - `imbui/infuse`: Tools to help you prototype your own custom components.

  - `imbui/pulse`: A lightweight package for atomic reactivity using signals and effects.

## Imbui Core
The core package provides an opinionated base for rapid development. It focuses on streamlined component registration, lifecycle management, and built-in dependency injection. The detailed API reference is a work in progress and will be available shortly.

### HTML Custom Elements
This section will detail how `imbui` leverages the web native custom element suite of APIs, such as shadowRoot, adoptedStylesheets, and others, to create encapsulated, reusable components.

### Baseline Standard APIs to Know
Coming Soon

### Services
Details about `imbui`'s service-based architecture and its influence from the MVVM pattern.

### Reactivity
`imbui` uses a signal-based approach to ensure fine-grained, atomic updates to the DOM, minimizing re-renders and improving performance.

### State
Coming Soon

### Routing
Coming Soon

***

## Imbui Infuse
Details on the infuse package, which provides tools to help you prototype and build your own custom components.

***

## Imbui Pulse
Details on the pulse package, a lightweight solution for atomic reactivity using signals and effects.

### Signals
Details on how to use signals atomically within web components or even Node.js applications.

### Effects
An elaboration on the mechanics of effects and how to use them.

## Inspirations / Alternatives
- Lit
-Solid.js and other reactive libraries.

This section will elaborate on the design patterns and architectural inspirations behind `imbui`, such as the MVVM pattern and the concept of Front-End "services" as UI providers.
