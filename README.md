# Imbui
**This Documentation is a work in progress**

**Imbui** is a modern and forward looking front-end toolkit for building HTML custom elements with TypeScript. Unlike all-in-one frameworks, imbui provides a transparent, modular foundation that helps teach you how the web works under the hood. Itâ€™s a workbench of composable utilities for atomic reactivity, declarative DOM updates, and service-based architecture, allowing you to build from the ground up or integrate with existing projects.

  - `imbui/core`: An opinionated core for a fast tracked workflow.

  - `imbui/infuse`: Tools to help you prototype your own custom components.

  - `imbui/pulse`: A lightweight package for atomic reactivity using signals and effects.
  
  > Think of `/core` as the workbench and `/infuse` as tools inside, `/pulse` contains the reactive primitives
  > that power it all.

## Quick Start


The simplest thing you can do with `imbui` is to grab the `signal` and `effect` primitives from `imbui/pulse`
```typescript

// Here's a toy example setting up a basic reactive pipeline
// First, import these from 'imbui/pulse'
import { signal, effect } from '@imbui/pulse';

// We'll going to create a 'signal' to hold our dynamic data.
// A signal can be any valueâ€”a string, number object, etc.
const myDynamicText = signal('My (maybe) first signal.');

// Next, let's create a <p> element to display the text.
const myParagraph = document.createElement('p');

// Now, we'll create an effect to automatically update the paragraph's
// textContent whenever myDynamicText's value changes.
effect(() => {
    
  // We're 'getting' the signal's value here.
  // This automatically sets up a dependency, so `effect` will
  // rerun whenever `myDynamicText` is updated.
  myParagraph.textContent = myDynamicText.get();

});



// To see it in action, let's append the paragraph to the body.
document.body.append(myParagraph);

setTimeout(() => {
  myDynamicText.set('The signal value has changed!');
}, 2000); // The paragraph's text will update after 2 seconds.
```
***

**`infuse`** offers some more fundamental pieces to get started building,
here is how easy a web component with reactivity built-in is to get set up:

```typescript

// First, import the signal primitive and the ReactiveWebComponentMixin.
import { signal, ReactiveWebComponentMixin } from '@imbui/infuse';

// This is our reactive state. We will connect it to our component.
const myDynamicText = signal('My other signal.');

// We use the ReactiveWebComponentMixin to add reactive capabilities
// to a standard HTMLElement.
class MyComponent extends ReactiveWebComponentMixin(HTMLElement) {
  constructor(){
    super();
  }
  // The connectedCallback is the best place to create effects.
  // The ReactiveWebComponentMixin automatically manages the effect's
  // lifecycle, ensuring it is properly disposed when the component
  // is removed from the DOM.
  connectedCallback(){
    // We create the effect here using the mxin's helper method.
    // This call automatically registers the effect for cleanup.
    this.createEffect(() => {
      this.textContent = myDynamicText.get();
    });
  }
}

// Register our new component definition with the custom element registry
window.customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);

// We'll create our new element with the native `createElement` API:
const myComponent = document.createElement('my-component');
document.body.append(myComponent);

// The component's text is now the initial signal value.
console.log(myComponent.textContent); // Outputs: "This is the initial text."

// At this point, signal is the initial value, 'My other signal.'
// If we change it, using `set()`:
myDynamicText.set('New signal text value');
// It's now updated. 
// And now every time the signal is set, the component updates automatically.

```

## Inspirations / Alternatives
- Lit web components
- Solid.js components, signal based reactivity
- Angular.js services
- MVVM
- and other reactive libraries using signals, observables, and novel reactive systems beyond traditional event queues or pub/sub

This section will elaborate on the design patterns and architectural inspirations behind `imbui`, such as the MVVM pattern and the concept of Front-End "services" as UI providers.
